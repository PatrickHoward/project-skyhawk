# Hawk Engine
Rust game engine built in mind for 3D rendered
environments.

## Another one? Why?
There's already a lot of Rust game engines and frameworks.
However, this project attempts to be different by:
* Aiming to provide more out-of-the box features for practical
game development.
  
* Aim to provide other forms of composition outside of ECS.
